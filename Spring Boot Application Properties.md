## Spring Boot Application Properties
    Spring Boot Application Properties allows us to define our own property if required.

    The application.properties file allows us to run an application in a different environment. In short, we can use the application.properties file to:

    * Configure the Spring Boot framework
    * define our application custom configuration properties
